    <textarea readonly>I created this website for two reasons
1. To show that I can create a website and,
2. To show any of my other computer Science related feats that I am planning to do in the future.


Some things that I've doen so far:
Built my first computer in less than two hours at 13,
Learned DuckyScript (The scripting language that BadUSBs use)
